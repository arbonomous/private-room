# Features in detail

Everything here runs in the browser unless it says otherwise. Back to the [README](../README.md).

## Feedback

"Send feedback" (home screen and More menu) sends one short note to the builders. The sheet shows the exact text before you tap Send. It contains only: worked / didn't work, your note, and, only if you tick the box, the app version, browser string and screen size. It never includes the room link or key, names, chat, files or anything about a call. Your network address is used only to limit spam (a salted hash kept for under an hour) and is not stored with the feedback. Notes are deleted after 60 days. Storage is a free Cloudflare D1 table written by `_worker.js`.

## Voice disguise

More menu > Voice disguise: Off (default), Deeper, Higher, Robot. It runs in your own browser on your microphone before the audio is sent, so the others hear the changed voice. It is a disguise, not anonymity: people can still recognise you by what you say and how you talk. "Hear myself" is off by default (use headphones, or you get echo). If the browser blocks audio processing, the call carries on with your normal voice. Effects use some battery on phones.

## Connection fallback

`/turn` (a Cloudflare Pages Function) hands the browser short-lived relay credentials (30 minutes). The long-lived secret stays on the server. The endpoint only answers same-site requests and is rate limited. The browser tries a direct path first and uses the relay only if that fails. `tests/relay-test.mjs` forces relay-only and sends data through it.

## Face disguise

More menu > Face disguise: Off (default, the untouched camera), Blur, Pixelate, Mask, Avatar. Everything runs in your own browser on your camera before anything is sent. Nothing is uploaded.

- Blur and Pixelate cover the whole picture.
- Mask and Avatar follow your face using Google's MediaPipe Face Landmarker, served from this site (`/mp/`), not a third-party CDN. The mask is drawn over a pixelated picture. The avatar replaces the whole picture with a cartoon face that follows your head, blinks and opens its mouth when you do. The files are about 17 MB and load only when you pick one of these. Until they are ready, you see a blur, never your raw camera. Face finding runs about 10 times a second on the CPU to save battery; drawing is capped at 15 fps and 480 px wide.
- It is a disguise, not anonymity: your voice, background and room can still identify you. If the browser can't capture a canvas or the files can't load, you get a chat note and a fallback.

Licenses: `@mediapipe/tasks-vision` 1.1.0 is Apache-2.0 (checked in its package.json). The `face_landmarker.task` model is published by Google alongside it; its model card license was not independently verified here. The big files are not committed: run `./fetch-mediapipe.sh` (pinned version, SHA-256 checked) before deploying. Tests: `tests/face-test.mjs`; `tests/face-real-test.mjs` runs a real face photo through the avatar and mask (needs `/tmp/face.y4m`).

## Speaker highlight, enlarge, install

The person who is talking gets a green outline (measured from the audio you already receive, in your browser). Tap a tile to enlarge it, tap again to go back. On phones, "Add to Home Screen" installs mut3d as an app. The service worker (`public/sw.js`) keeps only the app page and the face-tracking files so it opens offline. It never stores chat, files, feedback, relay credentials or room keys (the key is after the # in the link and is never part of a request).

## Invite, short link, room lock
- **Invite** button: shows a QR code of the link, a Share button (phones that support the share sheet), and Copy. The QR is drawn in the browser with the MIT-licensed `qrcode-generator`; nothing is fetched.
- **Short link** (optional, one tap): the full link is encrypted in your browser with a random 12-letter code. Our server stores only that ciphertext for 24 hours (D1, rate limited). The code lives after the `#` of the short link, so the server never sees the room key or the code. Anyone holding the short link can still join (same trust as the long link). Wrong code or expired: the page says so.
- **Lock room** (host, in More): refuses new knocks and clears the waiting list; guests already in stay. Enforced on the host's device. Unlock to accept knocks again.
- **Waiting list**: each person waiting has Let in / Deny; with two or more, "Let everyone in" and "Deny all" appear.
- Honest limit: lock and the waiting list live in the host's browser. If the host closes the tab, nobody is admitted.

## Theme and background blur
- **Theme**: Light/Dark button in More. Default is dark. The only thing stored on your device is the word `dark` or `light`.
- **Blur background only**: new option in the face-effect list. A small person-cutout model (MediaPipe selfie segmenter, about 250 KB, run in your browser, served from our own origin) keeps you sharp and blurs what is behind you. It does NOT hide your face. Until the model loads, the whole picture is blurred, never the raw camera. The model's licence was not independently verified (same status as the face model).
- Not yet tested on real phones: speed of the cutout on older iPhones. If it lags, use Blur or Pixelate.
